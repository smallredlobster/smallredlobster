🚀 About Me
🎓 I am Frederick Lau, a Final Year Software Engineering Student (specializing in Java, HTML & PHP) and specializing in Artificial Intelligence studies.

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and have contributed to several Gigantic Organizations including, Material UI, Microsoft, Amazon, Webhint, and countless others. I am exceptionally enthusiastic about learning new technology & take great pride in my ability to pick up skills swiftly.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. I push myself to multitask, doing Property Managementt Business on the side, connecting clients together and selling high demand products. My hobbies range from break dancing, paddle tennis, and guitar to some whacky ones like writing with my left hand.

📚 I love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite one is Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the financial literacy genre.

✈️ I am in love with traveling! I have been on numerous solo trips across SouthEast Asia, namely The Philippines, Bali, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal, and several others
